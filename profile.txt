Long ago, I traveled to Canada to retrieve my father's guitar from my grandfather's attic. 
                The idea of having an electric guitar and knowing how to play it is a feeling that resonated deeply with me, and I worked tirelessly to master
                simple chords, standard rock riffs, the pentatonic scale, and chord progressions. Getting my hands on that guitar for the first time was magical.
                It felt like I could finally be my full self. I became determined to create music that would resonate with others,
                and I started writing songs that reflected my journey, my struggles, and my triumphs. 
                I also fell in love with the mathematical beauty of music -- the way it can express complex emotions and ideas in a way that words sometimes cannot.
                I fell in love with the idea that it was all math, and that certain functions expressed or generated through time can become emotion and meaning.
                I became determined to speak the language of music, and to use it to capture new experiences and emotions.
