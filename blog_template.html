                                What a fantastic night at Linnaea's! We had a packed house and the energy was incredible. We played through a set of standards and debuted one of my new original compositions, "Cyan Tides". Thanks to everyone who came out to support us.

                                The band was on fire, and the new setup with the MIDI-controlled stage lights really added to the atmosphere. Looking forward to the next one!

                                After months of hard work, I'm thrilled to announce that the "Aurora" project deadline has been met. This involved developing a custom AI pipeline for a client to analyze video data, and the results have exceeded all expectations.
